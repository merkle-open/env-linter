This warning means, that your node version is not considered secure anymore. There has been a node release that fixes those vulnerabilities. Here is a [list of all node releases](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) and here you likely find [more details to the release and the vulnerability](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/). 

You need to update the node version of your project. You do **not** need to update to a new major version (e.g. from v14 to v16), a newer minor version is sufficient. Security releases are rolled out to all LTS versions of node.
