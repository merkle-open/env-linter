## Usage example

Feel free to use env-linter in any way that makes sense for your project. Here is an example of how env-linter could be applied as part of your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "postinstall": "env-linter -s -se -d -vs 'node=16.x.x,npm=8.x.x'",
  "prestart": "env-linter -h -vs 'node=16.x.x,npm=8.x.x'",
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/package.json": ["env-linter -s -d"]
  }
}
```

You can skip all env-linter checks by using the environment variable `ENV_LINTER_SKIP=true`. This could be useful on certain CI environments which are not automatically detected by env-linter.

## API usage

```js
const { api } = require('env-linter');

await api({
  versions: 'node=16.x.x,npm=8.x.x',
  hooksInstalled: true,
  saveExact: true,
  dependenciesExactVersion: true,
  lts: true,
  security: true,
});
```

## Options

### -vs, --versions [string]

Checks the installed versions of global packages or programs like node, npm, yo, etc. against a required version.
For example calling `env-linter --versions 'node=16.x.x'` will ensure that version 16 of node is being used. Multiple versions can be checked by separating them with a comma (eg. `--versions 'node=16.x.x,npm=8.x.x,yo=4.x.x'`).
env-linter will stop any further process-execution if a package or program does not satisfy the required version.

Calling env-linter with `--versions` but without any arguments will compare the installed node-version with the node-version from the `.node-version` file.

In any case, the used node version is compared to the list of [official node-releases](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json) and process-execution is stopped if the used npm version is older than the npm version that node comes with.

### -h, --hooksInstalled

Checks if git-hooks are installed (i.e. husky installed). env-linter will stop any further process-execution if git-hooks are not installed.

### -se, --security

Checks if the used node version is considered secure according to the current list of node releases. If a newer node-version is available which was released due to a security concern, env-linter will stop any further process-execution. Find out more about the security-flag in this [github issue](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/437).

### -s, --saveExact

Checks if the npm option `save-exact` is enabled, either through a .npmrc file in the project or in the user-directory. env-linter will stop any further process-execution if save-exact is disabled.

### -d, --dependenciesExactVersion

Checks if the version definitions of the dependencies and devDependencies in the `package.json` (or in a monorepository all available packages) are fitting our standards, which means; no approximate versions eg. tilde `~` or caret `^`, no star `*` wildcard and no tarball embeds via `https://*`.

### -l, --lts

Checks if the used node version is a LTS version. Here is some more information [why it might be a good idea to use an LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
